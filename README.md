# internet-game-data-base

Final grade project developed with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, just for learning purposes.

Using the MEAN Stack:
* [MongoDB](https://mongodb.org) as the non relational database
* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) as server side programming enviroment
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) as Web Oriented Framework for Node.Js
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) as MVC Client Side Framework

All game data comes from [thegamesdb.net](http://thegamesdb.net), not mine in any way. Thanks for that awesome work guys.

All feedback will be well received.
