# Internet Game Data Base

Final grade project developed with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, just for learning purposes.

With the name based on [Internet Movie Database](www.imdb.com/) and some functionalities taken from [Film Affinity](www.filmaffinity.com/), this is a videogame oriented website, where you can rate or comment your favourite videogames from all history, and get recommended by other users on what to play based on your rated videogames.

We are using the MEAN Stack:
* [MongoDB](https://mongodb.org) as the non relational database, saving all the games and users in NoSQL Documents.
* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) as server side programming enviroment, served as a REST API
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) as Web Oriented Framework for Node.Js
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) as MVC Client Side Framework, consuming Node API

All game data comes from [thegamesdb.net](http://thegamesdb.net), not mine in any way. Thanks for that awesome work guys.

All feedback will be well received.
